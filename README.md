# Enderman Head
Minecraft data and resource packs to add Enderman Head blocks to the game.

## Installation
Place the [Enderman Head Datapack directory](/Enderman%20Head%20Datapack/) in the world's datapacks folder: `MINECRAFT_HOME/saves/WORLD_NAME/datapacks`


Place the [Enderman Head Resource Pack directory](/Enderman%20Head%20Resource%20Pack/) in Minecraft's resource pack folder: `MINECRAFT_HOME/resourcepacks`

Boot up the world and apply the Enderman Head resource pack, ensuring it is above the default vanilla resource pack.
The datapack should be applied automatically.

## Usage
Enderman now drop their heads when killed by a supercharged Creeper.

Looking at a placed *Enderman Head* pulses redstone power and strongly powers the 
block it rests on.
The signal strength depends on the distance to the closest player looking at the block, up to 64 blocks away.

When worn by a player, the head will alert your head is being looked at by another player.
A *Spotted* effect icon will appear in the player's HUD when this happens.

Additionally, two new advencements are available: *Brainpower*, which obtained by looking at an Enderman Head, and its successor, *Headhunter*,which is obtained by acquiring all obtainable mob heads.
